## Inspiration and credit

This talk was given by [Amy Mok](https://github.com/amymok) (Developer at CFPB) and [David Leonard](https://github.com/davidrleonard) (Developer at Code for America). The legos exercise we used was inspired by ["How 90 minutes with Lego bricks taught these executives agile"](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/31/how-playing-with-legos-taught-executives-agile/), by Zach Cohn and Dave Zvenyach at 18F.
